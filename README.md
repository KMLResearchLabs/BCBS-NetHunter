# BCBS-NetHunter
The NetHunter for Termux, but with the KML and BCBS touch

Kali NetHunter in Termux is a great code, so inspired on it, KML Research Labs released BCBS NetHunter: a cybertool that can track 
IP's, make WHOIS consults, and etc. For now the system is in development phase, but, you can get an idea of what it is. Cheers!
